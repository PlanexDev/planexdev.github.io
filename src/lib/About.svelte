  <h1>0x01. About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I'm a student developer in middle school. I started programming when I was 8, when I found a
    book that taught me about modding <i>Minecraft</i> with Python. From that moment I knew that programming
    would probably be my job when I grow up.

    I just love how software development lets you do what you want without too many requirements.
    All you really need is a computer and a network connection, and you'll be able to do anything
    you want. Everything is done digitally, so you don't have to worry about large consequences when
    you try something new.
